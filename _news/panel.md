What a great experience this year, attending IEEE CCNC 2023 at Las Vegas, USA. I presented two papers, engaged in numerous discussions about state-of-the-art technologies and was invited to participate to the panel discussions on the "Role of Machine Learning in Next Generation Wireless Network".

Our two papers present our novel lightweight approach on tackling data drift for IoT sensor data at scale:
* LE3D: A Lightweight Ensemble Framework of Data Drift Detectors for Resource-Constrained Device
* Demo: LE3D: A Privacy-preserving Lightweight Data Drift Detection Framework

You can find more information about them [here](/assets/pdf/publications/le3dDemo.pdf) and [here](/assets/pdf/publications/le3dEvaluation.pdf).
