I am a Principal Research Engineer, working for Toshiba Europe Ltd. I am working in a number of R&D areas, spanning across
Cloud-native Computing, Cybersecurity, Machine Learning & Federated Learning, Sustainability, and Wireless Communications.

I am the lead back-end architect of the [UMBRELLA testbed](https://www.umbrellaiot.com), supporting multiple testbeds and IoT devices deployed in the northern Bristol, UK.

#### Research Interests:
Currently, my areas of interest span around Cloud-native technologies and Serverless Architectures, Cybersecurity for Industrial Control Systems, Digital Twins, and Sustainability for Machine Learning & Federated Learning deployments. In the past I worked in the areas of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITSs), and 5G Wireless Communications.
