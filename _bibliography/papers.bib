    abstract = {We present a large-scale, longitudinal visual dataset of urban streetlights captured by 22 fixed-angle cameras deployed across Bristol, U.K., from 2021 to 2025. The dataset contains over 526,000 images, collected hourly under diverse lighting, weather, and seasonal conditions. Each image is accompanied by rich metadata, including timestamps, GPS coordinates, and device identifiers. This unique real-world dataset enables detailed investigation of visual drift, anomaly detection, and MLOps strategies in smart city deployments. To promote secondary analysis, we additionally provide a self-supervised framework based on convolutional variational autoencoders (CNN-VAEs). Models are trained separately for each camera node and for day/night image sets. We define two per-sample drift metrics: relative centroid drift, capturing latent space deviation from a baseline quarter, and relative reconstruction error, measuring normalized image-domain degradation. This dataset provides a realistic, fine-grained benchmark for evaluating long-term model stability, drift-aware learning, and deployment-ready vision systems. The images and structured metadata are publicly released in JPEG and CSV formats, supporting reproducibility and downstream applications such as streetlight monitoring, weather inference, and urban scene understanding. The dataset can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17781192 and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17859120.},

    abstract = {GitOps has emerged as a foundational paradigm for managing cloud-native infrastructures by enabling declarative configuration, version-controlled state, and automated reconciliation between intents and runtime deployments. Despite its widespread adoption, the performance and scalability of GitOps tools in Intent-Based Networking (IBN) scenarios are insufficiently evaluated. This paper presents a reproducible, metric-driven benchmarking, assessing the latency and resource overheads of three widely used GitOps operators: Argo CD, Flux CD, and ConfigSync. We conduct controlled experiments under both single- and multi-intent scenarios, capturing key performance indicators such as latency and resource consumption. Our results highlight trade-offs between the tools in terms of determinism, resource efficiency, and responsiveness. We further investigate a realistic orchestration scenario, using Nephio as our orchestrator, to quantify the processing latency and overhead in declarative end-to-end deployment pipelines. Our findings can offer valuable insights for tool selection and optimisation in future autonomous network orchestration systems.},

Traditional security solutions often employ centralised management of components like firewalls and intrusion detection systems for consistent configuration. This centralisation introduces a single point of failure, risking severe consequences if compromised. While redundancy can mitigate concerns in IT systems, it does not scale well for larger systems. Edge computing, which pushes computation closer to endpoint devices, has been explored to improve scalability. The research community has also explored distributing and decentralising cybersecurity operations, especially intrusion detection, using new machine learning methods that mix centralised and distributed approaches to scale effectively while preserving data privacy. However, challenges remain in implementing these methods in large-scale IoT systems due to resource constraints. This paper evaluates intrusion detection methods in large-scale, resource-limited IoT systems, exploring the benefits of low-powered devices for network security and discussing solutions to current implementation challenges.},

A background setting for the architecture is provided by a survey of relevant projects, followed by a requirements analysis for FON orchestration and management. The proposed CDO architectural framework consists of four distinct views: the Organizational View identifies stakeholders and business entities; the Functional View outlines the logical design; the Cognitive \& AI/ML View connects logical functions with supportive cognitive functions for network optimization; and the System-level View links these functions to the necessary physical and intangible assets. This segregation enables each view to provide a focused analysis of the roles, interactions, and properties, thereby promoting a coherent design. The paper also describes a plausible partial proof-of-concept implementation of the CDO System-level architecture. Within the context of this CDO implementation, stakeholder participation in the provision of an end-to-end service delivery orchestrated across multiple network domains is described.},

    abstract={This study presents an empirical investigation into the energy consumption of discriminative and generative AI models within real-world MLOps pipelines. For discriminative models, we examine various architectures and hyperparameters during training and inference and identify energy-efficient practices. For generative AI, large language models (LLMs) are assessed, with a focus primarily on energy consumption across different model sizes and varying service requests. Our study employs software-based power measurements, ensuring ease of replication across diverse configurations, models, and datasets. We analyse multiple models and hardware setups to uncover correlations among various metrics, identifying key contributors to energy consumption. The results indicate that, for discriminative models, optimising architectures, hyperparameters, and hardware can significantly reduce energy consumption without sacrificing performance. For LLMs, energy efficiency depends on balancing model size, reasoning complexity, and request-handling capacity, as larger models do not necessarily consume more energy when utilisation remains low. This analysis provides practical guidelines for designing green and sustainable ML operations, emphasising energy consumption and carbon-footprint reductions while maintaining performance. This paper can serve as a benchmark for accurately estimating total energy use across different types of AI models.},

On-demand overlay network- ing technologies have shown a prominent maturity while coping with the rising complexity and scale of enterprise, service provider, and data centre networks. In the recent past, the Software-Defined Networking paradigm has offered Model Driven Programmability resulting in minimizing the network management complexity through automation and orchestration. However, leveraging Ma- chine Learning-driven network optimization, a.k.a. Knowledge- Defined Networking (KDN), has still been a domain of interest for the Network Softwarization research community. In this article, we propose Intelligent Routing as a Service (iRaaS) architecture as an application layer cognitive routing framework for KDNs. iRaaS offers routing logic customization (i.e., customizing metric function, path-discovery algorithm, etc.) and provides an option to include heuristic parameters from trained models as a part of the metric calculation. iRaaS sits on the application plane above the knowledge plane in a KDN stack, thus providing platform- and vendor-agnostic coupling with existing network infrastructures. This article covers the scope of iRaaS by using reliability as a heuristic for standard path-discovery algorithms e.g., Shortest Path First (SPF) and Diffusion Update algorithm (DUAL) along with the architectural specification.

    abstract={With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in urban environments, cities are increasingly deploying Edge processing nodes for urban sensing. This large-scale integration of Edge nodes and sensing endpoints raises significant security concerns. For instance, existing Intrusion Detection techniques cannot scale well and do not consider the privacy and energy consumption implications that emerge when applied to those systems. In addition, the use of containerised applications managed by container orchestration platforms in these environments, while enabling diverse applications and allowing scanning of the container images, can still introduce vulnerabilities. This Chapter addresses the challenge of effectively detecting such malicious activities in large-scale resource-constrained IoT systems. We introduce a semi-supervised distributed learning solution employing Federated Learning for real-time anomaly detection across the IoT infrastructure. Our approach involves analysing Linux system call data through a Federated Learning Framework, significantly reducing the need for central data processing. The Chapter presents a comprehensive architectural overview of the system, its core components, and the methodology for deploying and updating anomaly detection models. It also provides the performance evaluation of our approach. Our results demonstrate that the size of the clients datasets and the use of pre-trained models play a significant role in the performance of Federated Learning (FL) models in intrusion detection for large-scale IoT environments.

Additionally, we also immediately provide an updated global model to clients after they upload their local models to reduce idle time and improve training efficiency. We evaluate our approach within an AFL deployment consisting of 10 simulated clients with heterogeneous compute constraints and non-IID data. The simulation results, using the FashionMNIST dataset, demonstrate over 10% and 19% improvement in global model accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods PAPAYA and FedAsync, respectively.

    abstract={The way we travel is changing rapidly and Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITSs) are at the forefront of this evolution.  However, the adoption of C-ITSs introduces new risks and challenges, making cybersecurity a top priority for ensuring safety and reliability. Building on this premise, this paper introduces an envisaged Cybersecurity Centre of Excellence (CSCE) designed to bolster researching, testing, and evaluating the cybersecurity of C-ITSs. We explore the design, functionality, and challenges of CSCE's testing facilities, outlining the technological, security, and societal requirements. Through a thorough survey and analysis, we assess the effectiveness of these systems in detecting and mitigating potential threats, highlighting their flexibility to adapt to future C-ITSs.

    abstract = {The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) is a burgeoning market with projected growth in the upcoming years. RAN has the highest CAPEX impact on the network and, most importantly, consumes 73\% of its total energy. That makes it an ideal target for optimisation through the integration of Machine Learning (ML). However, the energy consumption of ML is frequently overlooked in such ecosystems. Our work addresses this critical aspect by presenting FROST - Flexible Reconfiguration method with Online System Tuning - a solution for energy-aware ML pipelines that adhere to O-RAN's specifications and principles. FROST is capable of profiling the energy consumption of an ML pipeline and optimising the hardware accordingly, thereby limiting the power draw. Our findings indicate that FROST can achieve energy savings of up to 26.4% without compromising the model's accuracy or introducing significant time delays.},

Intrusion Detection Systems play a crucial role in ensuring network security, actively identifying and mitigating malicious behaviours. However, the relentless advancement of cyber-threats has rendered traditional/classical approaches insufficient in addressing the sophistication and complexity of attacks. This paper proposes a novel 3-stage intrusion detection system inspired by a simplified version of the Lockheed Martin cyber kill chain to detect advanced multi-step attacks. The proposed approach consists of three models, each responsible for detecting a group of attacks with common characteristics. The detection outcome of the first two stages is used to conduct a feasibility study on the possibility of predicting attacks in the third stage. Using the ToN IoT dataset, we achieved an average of 94\% F1-Score among different stages, outperforming the benchmark approaches based on Random-forest model.  Finally, we comment on the feasibility of this approach to be integrated in a real-world system and propose various possible future work.},

Evaluating concept drift detectors on real-world data is ideal. Though many indoor datasets exist, our real-world dataset provides a natural, long-term collection of indoor environmental sensor readings over six months. The dataset consists of environmental sensor samples collected via eight IoT devices in a real office setting. The dataset is particularly useful for evaluating concept drift detection algorithms as spatial aspects can be used along with the signals.

    abstract={The vast increase of IoT technologies and the ever-evolving attack vectors and threat actors have increased cyber-security risks dramatically. Novel attacks can compromise IoT devices to gain access to sensitive data or control them to deploy further malicious activities. The detection of novel attacks often relies upon AI solutions. A common approach to implementing AI-based IDS in distributed IoT systems is in a centralised manner. However, this approach may violate data privacy and secrecy. In addition, centralised data collection prohibits the scale-up of IDSs. Therefore, intrusion detection solutions in IoT ecosystems need to move towards a decentralised direction. FL has attracted significant interest in recent years due to its ability to perform collaborative learning while preserving data confidentiality and locality. Nevertheless, most FL-based IDS for IoT systems are designed under unrealistic data distribution conditions. To that end, we design an experiment representative of the real world and evaluate the performance of two FL IDS implementations, one based on DNNs and another on our previous work on DBNs. For our experiments, we rely on TON-IoT, a realistic IoT network traffic dataset, associating each IP address with a single FL client. Additionally, we explore pre-training and investigate various aggregation methods to mitigate the impact of data heterogeneity. Lastly, we benchmark our approach against a centralised solution. The comparison shows that the heterogeneous nature of the data has a considerable negative impact on the model performance when trained in a distributed manner. However, in the case of a pre-trained initial global FL model, we demonstrate a performance improvement of over 20\% (F1-score) when compared against a randomly initiated global model.},

    abstract={Intelligent, large-scale IoT ecosystems have become possible due to recent advancements in sensing technologies, distributed learning, and low-power inference in embedded devices. In traditional cloud-centric approaches, raw data is transmitted to a central server for training and inference purposes. On the other hand, Federated Learning migrates both tasks closer to the edge nodes and endpoints. This allows for a significant reduction in data exchange while preserving the privacy of users. Trained models, though, may under-perform in dynamic environments due to changes in the data distribution, affecting the model's ability to infer accurately; this is referred to as concept drift. Such drift may also be adversarial in nature. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to detect such behaviours promptly. In order to simultaneously reduce communication traffic and maintain the integrity of inference models, we introduce FLARE, a novel lightweight dual-scheduler FL framework that conditionally transfers training data, and deploys models between edge and sensor endpoints based on observing the model's training behaviour and inference statistics, respectively. We show that FLARE can significantly reduce the amount of data exchanged between edge and sensor nodes compared to fixed-interval scheduling methods (over 5x reduction), is easily scalable to larger systems, and can successfully detect concept drift reactively with at least a 16x reduction in latency.},

We compare our method against state-of-the-art ensemble data drift detection frameworks, evaluating both the real-world detection accuracy as well as the resource utilisation of the implementation.

To address this problem, we present the \textit{resource-interaction graph} that is built directly from the audit log. We show that the resource-interaction graph's storage requirements are significantly lower than provenance graphs using an open-source data set with two container escape attacks captured from an edge device. We use a graph autoencoder and graph clustering technique to evaluate the representation for an anomaly detection task. Both approaches are unsupervised and are thus suitable for detecting zero-day attacks. The approaches can achieve f1 scores typically over 80% and in some cases over 90% for the selected data set and attacks.},

    abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) networks require regular firmware updates to ensure enhanced security and stability. As we move towards methodologies of codifying security and policy decisions and exchanging them over IoT large-scale deployments (security-as-a-code), these demands should be considered a routine operation. However, rolling out firmware updates to large-scale networks presents a crucial challenge for constrained wireless environments with large numbers of IoT devices. This paper initially investigates how the current state-of-the-art protocols operate in such adverse conditions by measuring various Quality-of-Service (QoS) Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of the shared wireless medium. We later discuss how Concurrent Transmissions (CT) can extend the scalability of IoT protocols and ensure reliable firmware roll-outs over large geographical areas. Measuring KPIs such as the mesh join time, the throughput, and the number of nodes forming a network, we provide great insight into how an IoT environment will behave under a large-scale firmware roll-out. Finally, we conducted our performance investigation over the UMBRELLA platform, a real-world IoT testbed deployed in Bristol, UK. This ensures our findings represent a realistic IoT scenario and meet the strict QoS requirements of today's IoT applications. },

    abstract={Edge computing is rapidly changing the IoT-Cloud landscape. Various testbeds are now able to run multiple Docker-like containers developed and deployed by end-users on edge devices. However, this capability may allow an attacker to deploy a malicious container on the host and compromise it. This paper presents a dataset based on the Linux Auditing System, which contains malicious and benign container activity. We developed two malicious scenarios, a denial of service and a privilege escalation attack, where an adversary uses a container to compromise the edge device. Furthermore, we deployed benign user containers to run in parallel with the malicious containers. Container activity can be captured through the host system via system calls. Our time series auditd dataset contains partial labels for the benign and malicious related system calls. Generating the dataset is largely automated using a provided AutoCES framework. We also present a semi-supervised machine learning use case with the collected data to demonstrate its utility. The dataset and framework code are open-source and publicly available.},

    abstract={A dataset of measurements of ETSI ITS-G5 Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) is presented. Our dataset consists of network interactions happening between two On-Board Units (OBUs) and four Road Side Units (RSUs). Each OBU was fitted onto a vehicle driven across the FLOURISH Test Track in Bristol, UK. Each RSU and OBU was equipped with two transceivers operating at different frequencies. During our experiments, each transceiver broadcasts Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) over the licensed DSRC band, and over the unlicensed Industrial, Scientific, and Medical radio (ISM) bands 2.4 GHz-2.5 GHz and 5.725 GHz-5.875 GHz. Each transmitted and received CAM is logged along with its Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) value and accurate positioning information. The Media Access Control layer (MAC) layer Packet Delivery Rates (PDRs) and RSSI values are also empirically calculated across the whole length of the track for any transceiver. The dataset can be used to derive realistic approximations of the PDR as a function of RSSI values under urban environments and for both the DSRC and ISM bands – thus, the dataset is suitable to calibrate (simplified) physical layers of full-stack vehicular simulators where the MAC layer PDR is a direct function of the RSSI. The dataset is not intended to be used for signal propagation modelling. The dataset can be found at https://doi.org/10.5523/bris.eupowp7h3jl525yxhm3521f57, and it has been analyzed in the following paper: I. Mavromatis, A. Tassi, and R. J.

A case in point is the development and optimization of Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITSs): a confluence of cyber-physical digital infrastructure and (semi)automated mobility. Herein we introduce Digital Twin for self-dRiving Intelligent VEhicles (DRIVE). The developed framework tackles shortcomings of traditional vehicular and network simulators. It provides a flexible, modular, and scalable implementation to ensure large-scale, city-wide experimentation with a moderate computational cost. The defining feature of our Digital Twin is a unique architecture allowing for submission of sequential queries, to which the Digital Twin provides instantaneous responses with the "state of the world", and hence is an Oracle. With such bidirectional interaction with external intelligent agents and realistic mobility traces, DRIVE provides the environment for development, training and optimization of Machine Learning based C-ITS solutions.},

Future city-scale ITS services will heavily rely upon the sensor data regularly off-loaded by each CAV on the Fog Computing network. Due to the broadcast nature of the medium, CAVs' communications can be vulnerable to eavesdropping. This paper proposes a novel data offloading approach where the Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) principle is used to ensure the probability of an eavesdropper to recover relevant portions of sensor data is minimized.

    abstract={Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) require ultra-low end-to-end delays and multi-gigabit-per-second data transmission. Millimetre Waves (mmWaves) communications can fulfil these requirements. However, the increased mobility of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), requires frequent beamforming - thus introducing increased overhead. In this paper, a new beamforming algorithm is proposed able to achieve overhead-free beamforming training. Leveraging from the CAVs sensory data, broadcast with Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) beacons, the position and the motion of a CAV can be estimated and beamform accordingly. To minimise the position errors, an analysis of the distinct error components was presented. The network performance is further enhanced by adapting the antenna beamwidth with respect to the position error. Our algorithm outperforms the legacy IEEE 802.11ad approach proving it a viable solution for the future ITS applications and services.},

High priority CAVs are particularly reliant on extended perception horizon facilitated by sensory data exchange between CAVs. Existing technologies such as the Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) are ill-equipped to provide advanced cooperative perception service. This creates the need for more sophisticated technologies such as the 5G Millimetre-Waves (mmWaves). In this work, we propose a distributed Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) mmWaves association scheme operating in a heterogeneous manner. Our system utilises the information exchanged within the DSRC frequency band to bootstrap the best CAV pairs formation. Using a Stable Fixtures Matching Game, we form V2V multipoint-to-multipoint links. Compared to more traditional point-to-point links, our system provides almost twice as much sensory data exchange capacity for high priority CAVs while doubling the mmWaves channel utilisation for all the vehicles in the network.},

Such systems rely on data collected from CAVs across the whole city operational area. This paper develops a Fog Computing-based infrastructure for future Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) enabling an agile and reliable off-load of CAV data. Since CAVs are expected to generate large quantities of data, it is not feasible to assume data off-loading to be completed while a CAV is in the proximity of a single Road-Side Unit (RSU). CAVs are expected to be in the range of an RSU only for a limited amount of time, necessitating data reconciliation across different RSUs, if traditional approaches to data off-load were to be used. To this end, this paper proposes an agile Fog Computing infrastructure, which interconnects all the RSUs so that the data reconciliation is solved efficiently as a by-product of deploying the Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) technique.

    abstract={Automated Vehicles are an integral part of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) and are expected to play a crucial role in the future mobility services. This paper investigates two classes of self-driving vehicles: (i) Level 4&5 Automated Vehicles (AVs) that rely solely on their on-board sensors for environmental perception tasks, and (ii) Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs), leveraging connectivity to further enhance perception via driving intention and sensor information sharing. Our investigation considers and quantifies the impact of each vehicle group in large urban road networks in Europe and in the USA. The key performance metrics are the traffic congestion, average speed and average trip time. Specifically, the numerical studies show that the traffic congestion can be reduced by up to a factor of four, while the average flow speeds of CAV group remains closer to the speed limits and can be up to 300% greater than the human-driven vehicles. Finally, traffic situations are also studied, indicating that even a small market penetration of CAVs will have a substantial net positive effect on the traffic flows.},

Our approach is scalable, insofar that takes into account the unique road and building shapes of each city, performing well for both regular and irregular city layouts. It allows us not only to achieve the required QoS constraints but it also provides up to 50\% reduction in the number of nodes required, compared to existing deployment solutions.},

    abstract={Millimetre Waves (mmWave) systems have the potential of enabling multi-gigabit-per-second communications in future Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs). Unfortunately, because of the increased vehicular mobility, they require frequent antenna beam realignments - thus significantly increasing the in-band Beamforming (BF) overhead. In this paper, we propose Smart Motion-prediction Beam Alignment (SAMBA), a MAC-layer algorithm that exploits the information broadcast via DSRC beacons by all vehicles. Based on this information, overhead-free BF is achieved by estimating the position of the vehicle and predicting its motion. Moreover, adapting the beamwidth with respect to the estimated position can further enhance the performance. Our investigation shows that SAMBA outperforms the IEEE 802.11ad BF strategy, increasing the data rate by more than twice for sparse vehicle density while enhancing the network throughput proportionally to the number of vehicles. Furthermore, SAMBA was proven to be more efficient compared to legacy BF algorithm under highly dynamic vehicular environments and hence, a viable solution for future ITS services.},

    abstract={Future Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) will be equipped with a large set of sensors. The large amount of generated sensor data is expected to be exchanged with other CAVs and the road-side infrastructure. Both in Europe and the US, Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) systems, based on the IEEE 802.11p Physical Layer, are key enabler for the communication among vehicles. Given the expected market penetration of connected vehicles, the licensed band of 75 MHz, dedicated to DSRC communications, is expected to become increasingly congested. In this paper, we investigate the performance of a vehicular communication system, operated over the unlicensed bands 2.4 GHz-2.5 GHz and 5.725 GHz-5.875 GHz. Our experimental evaluation was carried out in a testing track in the centre of Bristol, UK and our system is a full-stack ETSI ITS-G5 implementation. Our performance investigation compares key communication metrics (e.g., packet delivery rate, received signal strength indicator) measured by operating our system over the licensed DSRC an the considered unlicensed bands. In particular, when operated over the 2.4 GHz-2.5 GHz band, our system achieves comparable performance to the case when the DSRC band is used. On the other hand, as soon as the system, is operated over the 5.725 GHz-5.875 GHz band, the packet delivery rate is 30% smaller compared to the case when the DSRC band is employed. These findings prove that operating our system over unlicensed ISM bands is a viable option. During our experimental evaluation, we recorded all the generated network interactions and the complete data set has been publicly available.},

    abstract={As stated earlier, QoE is subjective, user-centric and content-dependent. Now is the time that QoS firstly, and more terms later come into foreground. Under QoS the idea is that transmission rates, error rates and other characteristics can be measured, improved and guaranteed in advance. By using parameters as bit rate, jitter, delay, packet loss, a service can be described and evaluated. Later in this article, the differences between QoS and QoE will be discussed in more detail. In addition with QoS, the term Class of Service (CoS) can also be found in the literature in order to describe the semantics and parameters of a specific type of QoS. Applications and services are categorized as symmetrical or asymmetrical judging by the equality of the bandwidth in both uplink and downlink directions. Also elastic and non-elastic characterizations where used, based on the minimum level of bandwidth needed and finally interactive and non-interactive depending on the human contact with a service Grade of Service (GoS) describes all the phenomena occurring during connection setup, release and maintenance. It appears mostly in circuit switched optical services and is the probability of the service to be blocked or delayed for more than a specific interval due to the high traffic intensity and the lack of available resources.Finally, Quality of Resilience (QoR) is perceived as one of the dimensions of QoS and covers the gray areas when a service is operational but not fully functional and is characterized as degraded. Approaches related to QoR are not well formalized as the ones in QoS, CoS, or GoS.},
