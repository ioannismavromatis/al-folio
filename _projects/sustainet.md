long_description: Amid global crises and declining influence in the global ICT market, Europe must act swiftly to secure technological sovereignty. The Celtic Next Flagship project SUSTAINET tackles this by focusing on resilient, energy-efficient, secure, and sustainable end-to-end networks. It emphasizes seamless digital system interconnection, ICT hardware/software innovation, and robust communication infrastructure — especially for critical services. With rising ICT reliance in areas like power management, future networks must support context-aware services and withstand failures and disasters. Sustainability is also central, as networks must adapt to renewable energy use and contribute to a carbon-neutral future. Achieving these goals demands coordinated R&D, industry collaboration, and strong government support to drive Europe’s digital and sustainable transformation.
