I am a Research Engineer, working for Toshiba Europe Ltd. Currently, I am the lead back-end architect of the UMBRELLA testbed that will support a 250+ node IoT testbed deployed in the northern Bristol, UK.

#### Research Interests:
My areas of interest span around Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITSs), and 5G Wireless Communications. Lately, I developed particular interest in Cloud-native technologies and Serverless Architectures, on Cybersecurity for Industrial Control Systems, and Digital Twins.
