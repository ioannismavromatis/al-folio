long_description: A large-scale dataset of ETSI ITS-G5 Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) network interactions. Two vehicles, fitted with OBU transceivers, exchanged broadcasts Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) with four RSUs, over the period of 8 recorded sessions of âˆ¼2h each. The experiment was conducted over the licensed DSRC band, and the unlicensed ISM bands, in order to compare the behaviour and the affect of interference. Each transmitted and received CAM is logged along with its RSSI value and accurate positioning information. The data are presented in raw PCAP traces and post-processed CSV files.
