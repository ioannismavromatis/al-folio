As the Lead 5G/Future Networks Technologist at Digital Catapult in London, UK, I work at the forefront of pioneering R&D in the field of future networks. 

My current involvement in the [REASON](https://www.linkedin.com/company/reason-open-networks/) focuses on the orchestration, seamless integration, and the delivery of an optimised end-to-end multi-technology, multi-vendor, ML-enabled, open 6G communication network.

I am one of the lead developers and architects of the [UMBRELLA ecosystem](https://www.umbrellaiot.com), supporting multiple testbeds and IoT devices deployed in the northern Bristol, UK. I frequently contribute to various open-source projects and I have extensive experience in designing, building and deploying large-scale IoT and 5G testbeds.

<br />

#### Research Interests:
Currently, my interests span around 5G & Beyond, Future Communication Networks, Sustainability for Machine Learning & Federated Learning, Cybersecurity and Cloud-native technologies. In the past, I worked in various areas around Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITSs), Serverless Computing, Industrial Control Systems, and Digital Twins.
