    abstract = {A dataset of body tracking information is presented. The dataset consists of 315 captured walking sequences. Each sequence is simultaneously captured by two Azure Kinect devices. The two captures are interleaved to effectively double the frame rate. Fifteen participants partook in this experiment. Each experiment consists of seven walking actions, and having three predefined trajectories per experiment. That results in 21 sequences per participant. The data were collected using the Azure Kinect Sensor SDK. They were later processed using the official tools and libraries provided by Microsoft. For each sequence and trajectory, the positions and orientations of thirty-two tracked joints were obtained and saved. The dataset is structured as follows. The experiments from each subject are saved in a single directory. Each directory contains multiple JSON files of timestamped body tracking information to enable the fusion of the two device streams. A calibration file is also provided, enabling the mapping of the coordinates between the two Azure Kinect devices capturing the data (mapping the coordinates of the device known as the Subordinate device to the Master device coordinate system). This data can be used to train neural networks for human motion prediction tasks or test pre-existing algorithms on Azure Kinect data. This dataset could also aid in gait recognition and analysis, as well as in performing action recognition and other surveillance activities.

    abstract={Intelligent, large-scale IoT ecosystems have become possible due to recent advancements in sensing technologies, distributed learning, and low-power inference in embedded devices. In traditional cloud-centric approaches, raw data is transmitted to a central server for training and inference purposes. On the other hand, Federated Learning migrates both tasks closer to the edge nodes and endpoints. This allows for a significant reduction in data exchange while preserving the privacy of users. Trained models, though, may under-perform in dynamic environments due to changes in the data distribution, affecting the model's ability to infer accurately; this is referred to as concept drift. Such drift may also be adversarial in nature. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to detect such behaviours promptly. In order to simultaneously reduce communication traffic and maintain the integrity of inference models, we introduce FLARE, a novel lightweight dual-scheduler FL framework that conditionally transfers training data, and deploys models between edge and sensor endpoints based on observing the model's training behaviour and inference statistics, respectively. We show that FLARE can significantly reduce the amount of data exchanged between edge and sensor nodes compared to fixed-interval scheduling methods (over 5x reduction), is easily scalable to larger systems, and can successfully detect concept drift reactively with at least a 16x reduction in latency.},

    abstract={Data integrity becomes paramount as the number of Internet of Things (IoT) sensor deployments increases. Sensor data can be altered by benign causes or malicious actions. Mechanisms that detect drifts and irregularities can prevent disruptions and data bias in the state of an IoT application. This paper presents LE3D, an ensemble framework of data drift estimators capable of detecting abnormal sensor behaviours. Working collaboratively with surrounding IoT devices, the type of drift (natural/abnormal) can also be identified and reported to the end-user. The proposed framework is a lightweight and unsupervised implementation able to run on resource-constrained IoT devices. Our framework is also generalisable, adapting to new sensor streams and environments with minimal online reconfiguration. We compare our method against state-of-the-art ensemble data drift detection frameworks, evaluating both the real-world detection accuracy as well as the resource utilisation of the implementation. Experimenting with real-world data and emulated drifts, we show the effectiveness of our method, which achieves up to 97% of detection accuracy while requiring minimal resources to run.},

The demand for higher resolutions and quality, the need for immersive video formats, and the newest, more complex video codecs increase the energy consumption in data centers and display devices. In this paper, we explore and compare the energy consumption across optimized state-of-the-art video codecs, SVT-AV1, VVenC/VVdeC, VP9, and x.265. Furthermore, we align the energy usage with various objective quality metrics and the compression performance for a set of video sequences across different resolutions.

However, provenance graphs can grow very large requiring significant computational resources beyond what is necessary for many security tasks and are not feasible for resource constrained environments, such as edge devices. To address this problem, we present the \textit{resource-interaction graph} that is built directly from the audit log. We show that the resource-interaction graph's storage requirements are significantly lower than provenance graphs using an open-source data set with two container escape attacks captured from an edge device. We use a graph autoencoder and graph clustering technique to evaluate the representation for an anomaly detection task. Both approaches are unsupervised and are thus suitable for detecting zero-day attacks. The approaches can achieve f1 scores typically over 80% and in some cases over 90% for the selected data set and attacks.},

FL is evaluated against benchmarks of centralised and (fully) personalised machine learning techniques for the classification task of the lampposts operation. Incorporating FL in such a scenario shows minimal performance reduction in terms of the classification task, but huge improvements in the communication cost and the privacy preserving.

    abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) networks require regular firmware updates to ensure enhanced security and stability. As we move towards methodologies of codifying security and policy decisions and exchanging them over IoT large-scale deployments (security-as-a-code), these demands should be considered a routine operation. However, rolling out firmware updates to large-scale networks presents a crucial challenge for constrained wireless environments with large numbers of IoT devices. This paper initially investigates how the current state-of-the-art protocols operate in such adverse conditions by measuring various Quality-of-Service (QoS) Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of the shared wireless medium. We later discuss how Concurrent Transmissions (CT) can extend the scalability of IoT protocols and ensure reliable firmware roll-outs over large geographical areas. Measuring KPIs such as the mesh join time, the throughput, and the number of nodes forming a network, we provide great insight into how an IoT environment will behave under a large-scale firmware roll-out. Finally, we conducted our performance investigation over the UMBRELLA platform, a real-world IoT testbed deployed in Bristol, UK. This ensures our findings represent a realistic IoT scenario and meet the strict QoS requirements of today's IoT applications. },

Our dataset consists of network interactions happening between two On-Board Units (OBUs) and four Road Side Units (RSUs). Each OBU was fitted onto a vehicle driven across the FLOURISH Test Track in Bristol, UK. Each RSU and OBU was equipped with two transceivers operating at different frequencies. During our experiments, each transceiver broadcasts Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) over the licensed DSRC band, and over the unlicensed Industrial, Scientific, and Medical radio (ISM) bands 2.4 GHz-2.5 GHz and 5.725 GHz-5.875 GHz. Each transmitted and received CAM is logged along with its Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) value and accurate positioning information. The Media Access Control layer (MAC) layer Packet Delivery Rates (PDRs) and RSSI values are also empirically calculated across the whole length of the track for any transceiver. The dataset can be used to derive realistic approximations of the PDR as a function of RSSI values under urban environments and for both the DSRC and ISM bands – thus, the dataset is suitable to calibrate (simplified) physical layers of full-stack vehicular simulators where the MAC layer PDR is a direct function of the RSSI.

    abstract={As we move towards autonomous vehicles, a reliable Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication framework becomes of paramount importance. In this paper we present the development and the performance evaluation of a real-world vehicular networking testbed. Our testbed, deployed in the heart of the City of Bristol, UK, is able to exchange sensor data in a V2X manner. We will describe the testbed architecture and its operational modes. Then, we will provide some insight pertaining the firmware operating on the network devices. The system performance has been evaluated under a series of large-scale field trials, which have proven how our solution represents a low-cost high-quality framework for V2X communications. Our system managed to achieve high packet delivery ratios under different scenarios (urban, rural, highway) and for different locations around the city. We have also identified the instability of the packet transmission rate while using single-core devices, and we present some future directions that will address that.},

    abstract={In a world where Artificial Intelligence revolutionizes inference, prediction and decision-making tasks, Digital Twins emerge as game-changing tools. A case in point is the development and optimization of Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITSs): a confluence of cyber-physical digital infrastructure and (semi)automated mobility. Herein we introduce Digital Twin for self-dRiving Intelligent VEhicles (DRIVE). The developed framework tackles shortcomings of traditional vehicular and network simulators. It provides a flexible, modular, and scalable implementation to ensure large-scale, city-wide experimentation with a moderate computational cost. The defining feature of our Digital Twin is a unique architecture allowing for submission of sequential queries, to which the Digital Twin provides instantaneous responses with the "state of the world", and hence is an Oracle. With such bidirectional interaction with external intelligent agents and realistic mobility traces, DRIVE provides the environment for development, training and optimization of Machine Learning based C-ITS solutions.},

Future city-scale ITS services will heavily rely upon the sensor data regularly off-loaded by each CAV on the Fog Computing network. Due to the broadcast nature of the medium, CAVs' communications can be vulnerable to eavesdropping. This paper proposes a novel data offloading approach where the Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) principle is used to ensure the probability of an eavesdropper to recover relevant portions of sensor data is minimized.

    abstract={Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) require ultra-low end-to-end delays and multi-gigabit-per-second data transmission. Millimetre Waves (mmWaves) communications can fulfil these requirements. However, the increased mobility of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), requires frequent beamforming - thus introducing increased overhead. In this paper, a new beamforming algorithm is proposed able to achieve overhead-free beamforming training. Leveraging from the CAVs sensory data, broadcast with Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) beacons, the position and the motion of a CAV can be estimated and beamform accordingly. To minimise the position errors, an analysis of the distinct error components was presented. The network performance is further enhanced by adapting the antenna beamwidth with respect to the position error. Our algorithm outperforms the legacy IEEE 802.11ad approach proving it a viable solution for the future ITS applications and services.},

    abstract={Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) require continuous access to sensory data to perform complex high-speed maneuvers and advanced trajectory planning. High priority CAVs are particularly reliant on extended perception horizon facilitated by sensory data exchange between CAVs. Existing technologies such as the Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) are ill-equipped to provide advanced cooperative perception service. This creates the need for more sophisticated technologies such as the 5G Millimetre- Waves (mmWaves). In this work, we propose a distributed Vehicle-to- Vehicle (V2V) mmWaves association scheme operating in a heterogeneous manner. Our system utilises the information exchanged within the DSRC frequency band to bootstrap the best CAV pairs formation. Using a Stable Fixtures Matching Game, we form V2V multipoint-to-multipoint links. Compared to more traditional point-to-point links, our system provides almost twice as much sensory data exchange capacity for high priority CAVs while doubling the mmWaves channel utilisation for all the vehicles in the network.},

Such a paradigm is referred to as the Internet of Vehicles (herein Internet of CAVs) and is a prerequisite to orchestrate traffic flows in cities. For optimal decision making and supervision, traffic centres will have access to suitably anonymized CAV mobility information. Safe and secure operations will then be contingent on early detection of anomalies. In this paper, a novel unsupervised learning model based on deep autoencoder is proposed to detect the self-reported location anomaly in CAVs, using vehicle locations and the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) as features. Quantitative experiments on simulation datasets show that the proposed approach is effective and robust in detecting self-reported location anomalies.},

    abstract={Future Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) will be supervised by cloud-based systems overseeing the overall security and orchestrating traffic flows. Such systems rely on data collected from CAVs across the whole city operational area. This paper develops a Fog Computing-based infrastructure for future Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) enabling an agile and reliable off-load of CAV data. Since CAVs are expected to generate large quantities of data, it is not feasible to assume data off-loading to be completed while a CAV is in the proximity of a single Road-Side Unit (RSU). CAVs are expected to be in the range of an RSU only for a limited amount of time, necessitating data reconciliation across different RSUs, if traditional approaches to data off-load were to be used. To this end, this paper proposes an agile Fog Computing infrastructure, which interconnects all the RSUs so that the data reconciliation is solved efficiently as a by-product of deploying the Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC) technique. Our numerical results confirm the feasibility of our solution and show its effectiveness when operated in a large-scale urban testbed.},

    abstract={Automated Vehicles are an integral part of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) and are expected to play a crucial role in the future mobility services. This paper investigates two classes of self-driving vehicles: (i) Level 4&5 Automated Vehicles (AVs) that rely solely on their on-board sensors for environmental perception tasks, and (ii) Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs), leveraging connectivity to further enhance perception via driving intention and sensor information sharing. Our investigation considers and quantifies the impact of each vehicle group in large urban road networks in Europe and in the USA. The key performance metrics are the traffic congestion, average speed and average trip time. Specifically, the numerical studies show that the traffic congestion can be reduced by up to a factor of four, while the average flow speeds of CAV group remains closer to the speed limits and can be up to 300% greater than the human-driven vehicles. Finally, traffic situations are also studied, indicating that even a small market penetration of CAVs will have a substantial net positive effect on the traffic flows.},

In our system model, we consider strict Quality-of-Service (QoS) constraints (e.g. high throughput, low latency) that are typical of ITS applications. Our approach is scalable, insofar that takes into account the unique road and building shapes of each city, performing well for both regular and irregular city layouts. It allows us not only to achieve the required QoS constraints but it also provides up to 50\% reduction in the number of nodes required, compared to existing deployment solutions.},

    abstract={Millimetre Waves (mmWave) systems have the potential of enabling multi-gigabit-per-second communications in future Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs). Unfortunately, because of the increased vehicular mobility, they require frequent antenna beam realignments - thus significantly increasing the in-band Beamforming (BF) overhead. In this paper, we propose Smart Motion-prediction Beam Alignment (SAMBA), a MAC-layer algorithm that exploits the information broadcast via DSRC beacons by all vehicles. Based on this information, overhead-free BF is achieved by estimating the position of the vehicle and predicting its motion. Moreover, adapting the beamwidth with respect to the estimated position can further enhance the performance. Our investigation shows that SAMBA outperforms the IEEE 802.11ad BF strategy, increasing the data rate by more than twice for sparse vehicle density while enhancing the network throughput proportionally to the number of vehicles. Furthermore, SAMBA was proven to be more efficient compared to legacy BF algorithm under highly dynamic vehicular environments and hence, a viable solution for future ITS services.},

    abstract={Future Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) will be equipped with a large set of sensors. The large amount of generated sensor data is expected to be exchanged with other CAVs and the road-side infrastructure. Both in Europe and the US, Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) systems, based on the IEEE 802.11p Physical Layer, are key enabler for the communication among vehicles. Given the expected market penetration of connected vehicles, the licensed band of 75 MHz, dedicated to DSRC communications, is expected to become increasingly congested. In this paper, we investigate the performance of a vehicular communication system, operated over the unlicensed bands 2.4 GHz-2.5 GHz and 5.725 GHz-5.875 GHz. Our experimental evaluation was carried out in a testing track in the centre of Bristol, UK and our system is a full-stack ETSI ITS-G5 implementation. Our performance investigation compares key communication metrics (e.g., packet delivery rate, received signal strength indicator) measured by operating our system over the licensed DSRC an the considered unlicensed bands. In particular, when operated over the 2.4 GHz-2.5 GHz band, our system achieves comparable performance to the case when the DSRC band is used. On the other hand, as soon as the system, is operated over the 5.725 GHz-5.875 GHz band, the packet delivery rate is 30% smaller compared to the case when the DSRC band is employed. These findings prove that operating our system over unlicensed ISM bands is a viable option. During our experimental evaluation, we recorded all the generated network interactions and the complete data set has been publicly available.},

    abstract={As stated earlier, QoE is subjective, user-centric and content-dependent. Now is the time that QoS firstly, and more terms later come into foreground. Under QoS the idea is that transmission rates, error rates and other characteristics can be measured, improved and guaranteed in advance. By using parameters as bit rate, jitter, delay, packet loss, a service can be described and evaluated. Later in this article, the differences between QoS and QoE will be discussed in more detail. In addition with QoS, the term Class of Service (CoS) can also be found in the literature in order to describe the semantics and parameters of a specific type of QoS. Applications and services are categorized as symmetrical or asymmetrical judging by the equality of the bandwidth in both uplink and downlink directions. Also elastic and non-elastic characterizations where used, based on the minimum level of bandwidth needed and finally interactive and non-interactive depending on the human contact with a service Grade of Service (GoS) describes all the phenomena occurring during connection setup, release and maintenance. It appears mostly in circuit switched optical services and is the probability of the service to be blocked or delayed for more than a specific interval due to the high traffic intensity and the lack of available resources.Finally, Quality of Resilience (QoR) is perceived as one of the dimensions of QoS and covers the gray areas when a service is operational but not fully functional and is characterized as degraded. Approaches related to QoR are not well formalized as the ones in QoS, CoS, or GoS.},
