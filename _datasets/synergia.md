long_description: A dataset based on the Linux Auditing System, which contains malicious and benign container activities. Two malicious scenarios were developed, i.e., a denial of service and a privilege escalation attack, where an adversary uses a container to compromise an edge device. The container activity is captured through the host system via system calls. The time series auditd dataset contains partial labels for the benign and malicious related system calls.
