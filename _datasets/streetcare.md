long_description: Each streetlight is photographed by a Raspberry Pi Camera Module v1, installed on each lamppost, providing a unique camera placement, photographic angle, and distance from the streetlight. Several streetlights are partially obstructed by vegetation, outside the Field of View (FoV) of the Raspberry Pi camera or affected by conditions (e.g., rain, snow, direct sunlight, etc.). This is a unique and diverse dataset of images that can be used for training tools and machine learning models for inspection, monitoring and maintenance use-cases within Smart Cities applications.
