long_description: The dataset consists of 315 captured walking sequences. Each sequence is simultaneously captured by two Azure Kinect devices. The two captures are interleaved to effectively double the frame rate. Fifteen participants partook in this experiment. Each experiment consists of seven walking actions, and having three predefined trajectories per experiment. That results in 21 sequences per participant. The data were collected using the Azure Kinect Sensor SDK. They were later processed using the official tools and libraries provided by Microsoft. For each sequence and trajectory, the positions and orientations of thirty-two tracked joints were obtained and saved.
