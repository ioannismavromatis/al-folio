#### About me:
I am a passionate in driving innovation and pioneering R&D in future wireless and networking systems.

I am currently involved as a Lead 5G/Future Networks Technologist in the [REASON](https://reason-open-networks.ac.uk) project with a focus on building a state-of-the-art open AI-native Multi-access 6G Communication network.

In my previous roles, I led as the backend architect and developer for the [UMBRELLA ecosystem](https://www.umbrellaiot.com), supporting multiple testbeds and IoT devices in the northern part of Bristol, UK, and contributed to various research areas around Machine Learning, Cybersecurity, and Wireless Communications.

Overall, I enjoy working with cutting-edge technologies, I am passionate about contributing to open-source projects and I specialise in designing, building and deploying large-scale IoT and 5G testbeds.

#### Research Interests:
Currently, my interests span around 5G & Beyond, Future Communication Networks, Sustainability for Machine Learning & Federated Learning, Cybersecurity and Cloud-native technologies. In the past, I worked in various areas around Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITSs), Serverless Computing, Industrial Control Systems, and Digital Twins.
