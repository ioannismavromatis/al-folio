title: Data Drift Streetlight Images Dataset
description: ~526k JPEG images of streetlight columns showing data drift across time.
year: 2025
length: 4 years

long_description: The dataset collected over several years shows an example of natural drift in a real deployment. The images collected inherently exhibits non-stationary visual distributions. This dataset provides a realistic fine-grained benchmark for evaluating long-term model stability, drift-aware learning, and deployment-ready vision systems.
