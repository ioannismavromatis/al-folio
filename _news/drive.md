**"Digital twin for self-dRiving Intelligent VEhicles (DRIVE)"** is an open-source vehicular network simulator that merges the world of Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITSs) and Artificial Intelligence.

It provides a flexible, modular, and scalable implementation to ensure large-scale, city-wide experimentation with a moderate computational cost, maintaining a high true-to-life representation of the world. DRIVE provides a bidirectional interaction with [SUMO traffic generator](https://www.dlr.de/ts/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-9883/16931_read-41000/) and can utilise real-world maps from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)

You can find more information about DRIVE from our [recent publication](/assets/pdf/publications/driveSimulator.pdf) and you can download the code from:
