#### About me:
I have over a decade of experience at the intersection of research and development, building robust, scalable, and forward-looking technologies that bridge lab innovation and real-world deployments.

Currently, I lead the technical delivery of [REASON-6G](https://reason-open-networks.ac.uk) and [guarDian](https://www.celticnext.eu/project-sustainet-guardian/) projects at Digital Catapult, focusing on multi-domain orchestration, self-healing network architectures, and energy-efficient AI/ML operations. My work spans Cloud-native Platforms, Machine Learning and Federated Learning, and large-scale system deployments and optimisations.

In my previous roles, I architected secure IoT platforms, designed Federated drift detection frameworks, led Green AI research activities, delivered optimisation mechanism for vehicular communications, and more. I was also the solution architect and main developer to the award-winning [UMBRELLA](https://www.umbrellaiot.com) project, delivering a real-world, city-scale IoT backend platform.

Overall, I enjoy working with cutting-edge technologies, I am passionate about contributing to open-source projects and delivering ideas end-to-end, from the inception, to the validation at large-scale environments.

#### Research Interests:
My interests span around Cloud-native computing, Future Communication Networks, Machine Learning & Federated Learning, Sustainability deployments, Cybersecurity and Service/Network orchestration.

In the past, I worked in various areas around Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs), Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITSs), Serverless Computing, Industrial Control Systems, and Digital Twins.
