I am very happy to announce the launch of my **new website**! I wanted to build a website for quite a while, and I finally took the time to do that...

This is going to be a space to share some important news on my career, present my work, my research interests and publications, and provide some more information about myself.

I chose to built it in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), to experiment with a new technology and static website generators, and I found it great! Many thanks to _Maruan Al-Shedivat_ for [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) theme. It is a excellent theme for academics, being simple and clean. I did various modifications to that to bring closer to my liking and you can now see the end result!
