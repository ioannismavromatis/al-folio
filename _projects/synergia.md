long_description: SYNERGIA will devise, develop and demonstrate a novel secure-by-design, endpoint-to-core IoT platform for large-scale networks of low-power resource-constrained devices. The platform will provide users with distributed processing capability at the Edge-as-a-service. Security issues will be addressed at all platform tiers, i.e., resource-constrained devices, Edge and backend.
