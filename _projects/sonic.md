long_description: The SONIC project is a world-leading innovation programme that investigates testing interoperability and integration of open, disaggregated and software-centric network solutions and multi-vendor architectures. As part of SONIC, I investigated how Verification, Validation and Testing (VVT) of AI/ML can be embedded in a testing pipeline of an MLOPs-enabled telco system.
