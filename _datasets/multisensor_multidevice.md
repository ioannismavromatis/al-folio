long_description: A dataset based of real-world sensor data, collected within an office environment at the University of Bristol. The office is actively used by a significant number of academic personnel and students (max occupancy of 28 people). It gets exposed to environmental changes such as seasonal temperature, humidity, and light fluctuations. The endpoints are located in different locations in the lab, showing locality and drift over time. Each IoT endpoint hosts sensors providing temperature, humidity, pressure, gas, accelerometer, and light readings. We collected two additional pieces of information, i.e., the measurements accuracy value, calculated by the environmental sensors, and the received signal strength indicator (RSSI).
