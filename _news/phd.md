It's official folks! I have a title now! **Dr Ioannis Mavromatis!**

For three years, I focused on the next-generation of Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems and how to enhance the connectivity of the autonomous vehicles. Hopefully, I managed to make the vehicles around us a bit smarter.

During my PhD is was involved in real-world car trials, designed my own system level simulator, got my hands dirty with new technologies, attended several conferences and media showcase events and even got a Popularity Award! Quite a lot of skills mastered, quite a lot of knowledge acquired. Definitely three years of my life that I will never forget.

If you are interested in reading what puzzled me the last three years and the innovative solutions I designed towards a 5G communication framework for smarter autonomous vehicles, you can download my thesis from [this link](/assets/pdf/publications/phdThesis.pdf).
